            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">Drones have been underutilized in the construction industry for a long time now. But with the changing technology trends, the construction industry is adapting itself too. Drones have increased safety and accuracy in this sector alongside reducing the total cost of the project. Lack of knowledge about drones and their capabilities in the field of construction is a liability.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">Beyond the predictable deliverables, aerial site intelligence is more beneficial for construction
projects. Drones used to capture construction progress are a sure-fire way of collecting all
relevant data, as is and without prejudice, in a much faster and effective manner. More than half of construction projects fall short of their timelines and budgets. Using drone technology in construction will assist in meeting these goals without incurring exorbitant costs. Drones will help you get the job done, whether for evaluation, data collection, or transportation. Drones have already proven their worth to a few construction companies. They're constantly looking for ways to put them to use for their company and customers. If the use of drones in construction grows, further advances can benefit the construction industry and beyond.

            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">It is important to understand the purpose of drones in each stage and appreciate the amount of progress that can be made with them during a project.

Initiation: Every venture begins with a piece of land. An aerial analysis of the land can quickly
capture the territory and its challenges, allowing informed decisions about how development can
occur. Upon request, specific geological guides and 3D models can be obtained to produce a lot more information on the direction of work.

Planning: Project plans are made based on the information gathered during the overview.
During this time, drone imaging will showcase the current reality of the land's difficulties for
the development plan, rather than leaving it to suspicion. GIS planning also allows for 3D imaging of what the project will look like when it is completed.

Execution: This is the most crucial stage of growth as everything starts happening at the same
time. Drone tours are a viable alternative to on-site tours. It gives a birds-eye view to the
customers and other stakeholders. Also, it allows to take pictures of construction sites and
provides stakeholders and consumers with real-time alerts. The ability to monitor the progress remotely and store data in the cloud makes it easier to carry worksites to the workplace.
It increases customer satisfaction and acts as a customer magnet to sell to more customers.

Handover: At this stage of construction, from the outside, everything appears fine until the
project is completed. It takes drones' technological prowess to detect any heat leaks with their
thermal imaging feature. Drones keep track of the "invisible"â€”what flows through the walls,
underground pipes, and so on. It uses technology to match the model with the output of
construction and checks to identify any deviation and anomalies from the design drawings.

The mentioned features above shall help increase the speed of work and reduce the cost needed to perform the same task using manpower and reduce the risk of accidents.
